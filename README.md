# 3D Growth & Remodeling of Soft Biological Tissues - Homogenized Constrained Mixture Model

The homogenized constrained mixture model is implemented in **Abaqus** through a coupled **User-defined MATerial subroutine (UMAT)**. This computational model facilitates the simulation of various Growth & Remodeling (G&R) processes in soft biological tissues within the body. Originally designed for aneurysm growth simulations ([Braeu et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27921189/) and [Braeu et al. 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30413985/)), it has been adapted for cardiac G&R ([Amadeus et al. 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10237-023-01747-w)).

In this context, we have utilized the homogenized constrained mixture model to simulate ophthalmic G&R processes. Specifically, our focus was on investigating whether G&R theory could provide insights into staphyloma formation resulting from local scleral weakening. In the examples folder, you'll find the Abaqus input file to simulate the formation of a Type-III staphyloma through local scleral weakening.
